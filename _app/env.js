So creating it in static is\nprobably more future proof.\n\nNote that the `jekyll: false` argument I gave to the adapter factory\nin `svelte.config.js` was not a real argument so it didn't do anything\nand was silently ignored.","PUBLIC_GITHUB_COMMIT_SHA":"19a72aea2efb25404be482c52ee34e8aa3f16028"}
